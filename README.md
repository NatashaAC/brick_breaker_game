# Brick Breaker Game
One summer I decided to re-created the brick breaker game using html, css and vanilla JavaScript. It was a fun experience because I really wanted to learn how to create games and by doing this it helped me with the food grab game.

### Gameplay
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle back and forth
- Bounce the ball off the paddle to hit each brick
- Clear all bricks in order to win
